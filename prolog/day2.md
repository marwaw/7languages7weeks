* A real-world community using Prolog. What problems are they solving with it today?

If you’re looking for something more advanced to sink your teeth into, try these problems:

* An implementation of the Towers of Hanoi. How does it work?

* What are some of the problems of dealing with “not” expressions? Why do you have to be careful with negation in Prolog?

Do:
